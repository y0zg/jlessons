//		Initialization occurs just before the main method is executed.
//		However, before the specified class can be initialized, its parent class will have to be initialized.
//		If the parent class has not been loaded and linked, the JVM will first load and link the parent class.
//		Again, when the parent class is about to be initialized, the parentâ€™s parent will be treated the same.
//		This process occurs recursively until the initialized class is the topmost class in the hierarchy.
